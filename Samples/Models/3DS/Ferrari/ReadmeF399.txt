   Ferrari F399 formula one race car

   This is the car driven by Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine and Mika Salo in the 1999 Formula One World Championship.
   
   The model was built in Amapi4.1 and trueSpace3.0. in early august 2000.
   The textures maps were scanned from various photos in racing magazines.
   This 3ds model is a "light" version of the highly detailed original model, which includes a driver figure wearing  
   Michael Schumacher's helmet, and parts such as : detailed brake discs, complete V10 engine, inner airducts, profiled
   wings, mapped gearbox, and so on ...

   I'm highly interested in racing cars and WW2 aircraft models,so if you want to share models, textures and any documentation
   please contact me :

   This model is freeware and you can use it in any project you plan.
   Please mail me to tell me what it was used for then.
